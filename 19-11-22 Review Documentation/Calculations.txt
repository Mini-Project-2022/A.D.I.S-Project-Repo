Battery Calculations:

Consumption-
1. Node MCU= 80mA/h
2. Soil Moisture sensor=approx 20mA/h

Total consumption=(80+25)mA/h=approx 100mA/h

Total Consumption(with safety factor of 1.2x)=120ma/h

Average Capacity of unit AA Battery=800mA/h
Capacity of 4xAA Batteries=(800*4)mA/h=3200mA/h

Estimated Runtime of sensing system=(3200/120)hrs= Approx 26 Hours 

Adapter Sizing:

Consumption-
1. Node MCU= approx 0.6W
2.2-Channel Relay= 0.25W
3. Solenoid Valve= Approx 18W

Total Consumption= [(18+0.6+0.45)*1.2]=22.6w

Since valve requires 12v to operate by default,
total current output required =(22.62/12)=approx 2A

Hence Adapter Selected is a 12V,2A Adapter.


Flow calculations-
1.  Q = m^3/h Flow
2. Δp = bar   Pressure drop(differential pressure between inlet and outlet) 
3.  p = Kg/dm^3 Relative density referred to water.
4. Kv = m^3/h Flow coefficient 

Flow Q = Kv sqrt(Δp/p) 
Since the flow rate is dependent on the pressure of the water supply it has to
be calculated separately for each installation.
